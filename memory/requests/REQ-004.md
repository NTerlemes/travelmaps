# REQ-004: Show subdivision outlines in merged regions

**Label:** `ux/merged-outlines`
**Status:** `done`
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Description
Merged (compacted) regions should show visible outlines of the individual subdivisions within them, so users can see what was compacted.

## Files Changed
- `src/hooks/useGeoData.ts` — add `_merged` flag on merged features
- `src/hooks/useGeoData.test.ts` — verify `_merged` flag
- `src/components/TravelMap.tsx` — style merged features with more visible borders

## Verification
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Merged regions show internal subdivision borders visibly
