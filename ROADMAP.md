## Risk Mitigation (Solo Context)

### Technical Risks
- **Over-engineering** - Keep it simple, avoid complex solutions
- **Technical debt** - Maintain test coverage, regular refactoring
- **Dependency issues** - Pin versions, regular updates

### Personal Risks
- **Burnout** - Maintain sustainable pace, celebrate small wins
- **Scope creep** - Focus on core value, resist feature bloat
- **Perfectionism** - Ship early, iterate based on real usage

### Business Risks
- **Low usage** - Focus on personal use case, share with friends/family
- **Maintenance burden** - Choose stable, well-supported technologies
- **Feature complexity** - Add features only when clearly needed
