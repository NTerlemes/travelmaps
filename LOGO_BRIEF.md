# Logo Design Brief — mytravelmap.io

## About the Product
mytravelmap.io is a web app where users create personal travel maps by clicking on countries and regions to "paint" them with colors representing travel statuses (visited, lived there, from here, live here now). Users can add custom statuses with custom colors. Maps are shareable via link and exportable as images. The overall feel is clean, modern, and minimal.

## Brand Name
**mytravelmap** (all lowercase, one word)
- Domain: mytravelmap.io
- Often displayed as: mytravelmap.io

## What the Logo Needs to Communicate
- Travel / exploration / the world
- The act of coloring or painting a map (the core interaction)
- Personal — it's *your* map, your story
- Modern, approachable, not corporate

## Logo Usage (all must work)

| Context | Size | Details |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Favicon** | 16x16 / 32x32 px | Icon mark only, must be recognizable at tiny size |
| **Watermark (exports)** | ~80px wide | Semi-transparent, bottom-right corner of map images. Must not distract from the map |
| **Watermark (web view)** | ~120px wide | Same placement, CSS overlay on shared map pages and embeds |
| **Landing page** | ~200px wide | Full logo (icon + wordmark), centered on white/light gray background |
| **Social preview (og:image)** | Small in corner | Appears in auto-generated map thumbnails for Twitter/WhatsApp/iMessage |
| **Browser tab** | 16x16 | Favicon context, next to "mytravelmap.io" page title |

## Deliverables Needed
1. **Icon mark** — standalone symbol, works at 16px and up
2. **Full logo** — icon mark + "mytravelmap.io" wordmark, horizontal layout
3. **Watermark variant** — icon mark + "mytravelmap.io" in a single line, designed for semi-transparent overlay on light map backgrounds
4. All in **SVG** (vector) + **PNG** (transparent background, multiple sizes)
5. Dark version (for light backgrounds) and light/white version (for dark contexts)

### What to avoid
- Overly detailed or realistic globes (won't work at small sizes)
- Airplane icons (too generic, every travel app uses them)
- Suitcase/luggage imagery (this is about maps, not packing)
- Clip-art or stock-logo feel
- Too many colors — keep it to 2-3 max in the mark, or use the single primary color for mono versions
